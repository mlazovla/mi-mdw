    Try insert your SVG file ;-).

	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<p><strong><em>SVG Parser: do not find Path element in svg.</em></strong></p>
	<p>Sorry, we are comparing by path element. If the SVG does not have included path element (drawing contains only geometry primitives and/or text), we cannot compare. You can convert all objects to curves and try it again.</p>
